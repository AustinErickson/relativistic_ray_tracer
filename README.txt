# relativistic_ray_tracer

This project is an undergraduate thesis advised by Kathryn Z. Hadley,
submitted to the Department of Physics at Oregon State University
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree BS in Physics.

The purpose of this project is to visualize curved space-time near compact masses, 
and to generate images that showcase relativistic effects on light towards training
a machine learning algorithm to detect and locate neutron stars in real images.
